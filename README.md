My first project as a web developer during CoderHouse classes


I want to highlight this project because it was the first one I uploaded and created as a product of a class named Web Development during my course in Coderhouse. This was made with a lot of commits and it is because
I wanted to practice and verify all the changes on the website during the classes. I am open to receiving all the corresponding feedback, I think that is the best way to learn and improve every day. The site is built 
with real information. Finally, I just want to say I put all my effort into this and hope it is going to be the beginning of this beautiful path as a programmer.
